# Happy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## The Problem

I uses Figma to plan for the project and which components I needed to have and what the components should include. If I had more time and more freedom with the project I would have loved to add more funcionalities and other styling to it.
